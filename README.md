## Spatie Permissions

This admin panel leverages the Spatie Permissions package to provide role-based access control. To secure a Livewire component, you can use the following authorization method within the component:

```php
$this->authorize('update:admin', Auth::guard($this->guardName)->user());
```

You can use permissions like:

```php
@can('view:admin', 'guard_name')
    <!-- Content for users who have the 'view:admin' permission -->
@endcan
```

With Spatie Permissions, you can easily define and control what different roles can access in the admin panel.

## Settings Management

The admin panel includes a settings management system that allows you to configure various aspects of your site. Settings are grouped into **General** and **Social** categories:

- **General Settings**: These settings have keys like `site_general_name` or `site_general_textarea_description`. They are displayed under the **General** tab.
- **Social Settings**: These settings have keys like `site_social_facebook` and are displayed under the **Social** tab.

### Field Type Detection

- If a setting key contains `textarea`, it will be rendered as a `<textarea>` field in the admin panel.
- Otherwise, it will be rendered as an `<input>` field, providing a straightforward user experience for data entry.
